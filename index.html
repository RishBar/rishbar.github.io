      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I am a full-stack web developer who recently graduated from Lighthouse Labs, a web development bootcamp. Before joining this bootcamp I was studying computer science at Queen's University for two year where I was having a hard time finding the motivation to study and attend my courses. This led me to decide to drop out. I felt like I had no sense of direction while studying at a university as I was not learning anything relevant to actually working in the tech industry. I now see that this lack of direction was the reason I had a hard time motivating myself to do any work at university.</p>
      <p>Working at Lighthouse Labs was a completely different experience as everything I was learning seemed directly applicable to things I may encounter in the workforce. I made various websites such as a scheduler app with React, an online store made with Rails, and for my final project I decided to do something a little more fun and build an online game with a gaming framework called Phaser with my partner. We even managed to get this game deployed with heroku <a href="https://shoot-io.herokuapp.com/">here.</a> It was a breath of fresh air to know that I was not just lazy and I was capable of working hard when I needed to. I just needed to learn in a practical way that can keep me engaged. This is why I want to join the tech industry. I want to surround myself with smart people that I can learn from while also building software which provides real value.</p>
      <p>In the meantime I am building projects that sound fun to me. For instance, my latest project was a naive implementation of Shopify that I decided to build to get a better understanding of how Shopify's data model is shaped.</p>
      <p>When I am not practicing coding or building projects, I am usually playing Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild on my Nintendo Switch or watching videos on youtube about One Piece, my favourite manga that I have been reading since I was 13 years old. Some activities I love are snowboarding, which I would not say I am very good at but is probably my favourite way to spend time, and riding my bike down long hills.</p>
