      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I am a full-stack web developer who recently graduated from Lighthouse Labs, a web development bootcamp. Before joining the bootcamp I was studying computer science at Queen's University. I was enrolled for two years before I dropped out due to a lack of motivation. In university, I was completely lost - I had anxiety about entering the job force without any tangible software development experience.</p>
      <p>Lighthouse Labs was a completely different experience. We worked on projects that you could imagine implementing at a tech company, or as a freelancer. We used technologies that were actually used in the industry. Everything I was learning seemed directly applicable to things I may encounter in the workforce.</p>
      <p>Some examples of things I built:</p>
      <p>- An interview scheduler app with React</p>
      <p>- An online store made with Ruby on Rails</p>
      <p>For my final project I decided to do something a little more fun and build an online game with a gaming framework called Phaser. We managed to get this game deployed on Heroku <a href="https://shoot-io.herokuapp.com/">here.</a></p>
      <p>It was a breath of fresh air to realize that I am not lazy, as my failure to complete university led me to believe. I now understand that I need to work on real projects to keep me engaged and learning. This is why I want to join the tech industry. I want to surround myself with smart people that I can learn from while also building software which provides real value. Software development is one of the few fields where anyone with a computer can start learning and build a meaningful career without asking for permission. </p>
      <p>In the meantime I am building projects that sound fun to me. For instance, my latest project was a naive implementation of Shopify that I decided to build to get a better understanding of how Shopify's data model is shaped.</p>
      <p>When I am not working on side projects I am usually playing Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild or watching/reading my favourite manga, One Piece. I sometimes leave my house as well. I love snowboarding, which I would not say I am very good at, and riding my bike down long hills.</p>
