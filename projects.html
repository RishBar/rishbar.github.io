        <div class="project-description">
          <p>Shoppingfy is a naive implementation of Shopify. The app has been deployed with Heroku, click the logo to be taken to the website. This app was built with Ruby on Rails 6, and the reasoning behind making the app was to gain a better understanding of how Shopify's database works. I had a lot of fun building the website, and it gave me an introduction to storing uploaded images with AWS s3 buckets.</p>

          <p>Shoot-io is multiplayer top-down shooter game developed with Phaser, a gaming framework made by <a href="http://www.photonstorm.com/">Photon Storm</a>. The game has been deployed with Heroku, click the logo to play the game, but you will need a mouse and keyboard and somebody to play with. This app was built with phaser, express and socket.io and was a lot of fun to build as my final project for Lighthouse Labs with my partner Brandon Macleod.</a></p>

        <div class="project-description">
          <p>Scheduler is a single page web application built with react that allows users to book, edit, and delete interviews. The schedule is served by an api running separately and interviews that are booked on the client side will update the api and automatically render the new appointment. The app has not been deployed however you can click the logo to find the github repository and follow the README to get the app running locally.</p>
