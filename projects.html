        <div class="project-description">
          <p>Shoppingfy is a naive implementation of Shopify. The app has been deployed with Heroku, click the logo to be taken to the website. This app was built with Ruby on Rails 6, and the reasoning behind making the app was to gain a better understanding of how Shopify's data model works. I had a lot of fun building the website, and it gave me an introduction to storing uploaded images with AWS S3 buckets.</p>
