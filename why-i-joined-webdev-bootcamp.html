      <h1>Why I Joined a Web Development Bootcamp</h1>
      <p>I recently graduated from a web development bootcamp called <a href="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/about">Lighthouse Labs</a> and I wanted to write about my experience. Specifically, I want to explain what led me to the bootcamp. In my following blog post I will write about my experience during the bootcamp, and whether I would recommend the experience to others looking to become a web developer.</p>
      <p>Before Lighthouse Labs, I was a student at Queen’s University studying computer science. After my two years of study I was required to withdraw for one year because I failed to meet the minimum required GPA. This was a huge blow to my self-esteem. While I knew I was capable of success, a combination of a lack of willpower and poor mental health kept me from succeeding. I would always leave my work until the last day before the deadline and then convince myself that I could finish it in time. In the end, this caught up to me. I left so many assignments partially, or completely unfinished that I was forced to withdraw. I was devastated at the situation I put myself in.</p>
      <p>During my time away from Queen’s, I worked minimum wage labour jobs to earn money to pay for the day when I returned to university. When the day arrived to send a letter to the university explaining what I had done with my time off, I realized that I really had not done much. To begin, I didn't even know what I should have done with my time off to become confident that I could improve my GPA. The problem lied in my mentality and not the challenge of the workload. For whatever reason I could not bring myself to do my coursework on time. This made me reflect on whether a university environment is the optimal learning environment for me. After a bit of soul-searching I realized I absolutely hated the idea of university. The main reason was the lack of connection to the real world. I rarely came across a lecture where a professor would say “this is something you might encounter in the workforce”. There was no sense of urgency in learning the material that I was being taught -  it was all just a matter of completing abstract homework assignments  and getting at least a C. It finally made sense why I could not bring myself to do my work on time. Since I had no perspective about what it meant to build actual software, I couldn’t see the value of learning about abstract software engineering theories.  All the theory we were learning would have been more meaningful if I could relate it to some concrete software I had built. For instance, complexity theory only became interesting to me when I actually created a database and saw how adding indexes to my tables can reduce the data retrieval time. When I came to the conclusion that the university environment was not optimal for my own style of learning, I was relieved. I just needed to find out how I could continue down my own path.</p>
      <p>This was around the time when my brother directed me to the series of courses called <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/courses">Learn Enough to be Dangerous</a> by <a href="https://www.michaelhartl.com/">Michael Hartl.</a> He recommended this course to me because it teaches aspiring developers about web development in an organized way. Each course in the tutorial builds on the last one starting from the first course, Learn Enough Command Line to be dangerous, to the last, Learn Enough Ruby on Rails to be dangerous. The goal of the course was that by the end you would have all the fundamental knowledge you need to build a clone of Twitter with Ruby on Rails. I wrote a blog post about why I believe Ruby on Rails was the perfect web development framework for me to learn as somebody with no experience in the field, and I still agree with my take. It was empowering to know that I could learn how to build a website in such a short amount of time especially considering how I had such a hard time motivating myself to do work in university. This also confirmed to me that I was capable of learning how to become a developer.</p>
      <p>While I was building confidence in my skills as a programmer, I wanted to have built a portfolio of  interesting projects and experiences that would help me prepare for a career in the tech industry. There are soft skills that you need in order to land a job as a developer. For example, you need to be able to communicate about code concisely, and this is something that is hard to practice unless you do some mock interviews. Pair-programming without getting nervous is also a useful skill to have. I believed that  building projects with a team and with some mentor guidance would be perfect to really assimilate myself into the tech workforce, however I didn’t know where I was going to find the opportunity to do these things without actually landing a job as an intern or junior developer. This is when my brother recommended I do a web development bootcamp, which led me to Lighthouse Labs. He knew they had a good reputation because he knew coworkers who were alumni from the same bootcamp. They all had positive things to say about their experience there. The interview consisted of a few questions asking me about why I want to learn how to program, and what experience I had with programming. After about thirty minutes, we did a logic test. I had 10 minutes to answer 5 questions that did not have anything to do with programming. The questions were similar to what you might find on an IQ test, and while I was not a fan of this process, I was pretty relieved to find that I passed. A few weeks later I found that I was accepted into the bootcamp. Read my next blog post to learn more about my experience during the course of the bootcamp!</p>
