      <h1>Why I Joined a Web Development Bootcamp</h1>
      <p>I recently graduated from a web development bootcamp called <a href="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/about">Lighthouse Labs</a> and I wanted to write about my experience. Specifically in this blog post, I want to write about what led me to join the bootcamp, and in my following blog post I will write about whether the bootcamp met my expectations. But in short, I had an awesome time and I feel very grateful to have a skillset that I know will be of value to anyone who wants to do anything on the internet.</p>
      <p>Before I joined Lighthouse Labs, I was a student at Queen’s University studying computer science. After my second year in university I was required to withdraw for one year after failing to meet the minimum required GPA. This was a huge blow to my self-esteem. While I knew I was capable of graduating and even possibly doing well in university, my mental health kept me from succeeding. I would always leave my work until the last day before it was due and then convince myself that I was capable of finishing it. All this culminated into me being required to withdraw for one year and being very devastated at the situation I put myself in.</p>
      <p>During my time away from university, I decided to work minimum wage labour jobs to earn some money for when I go back to school. When it was time to send a letter to the university explaining what I had done with my time off to make sure I can improve my gpa, I found myself realizing that I really had not done much. To begin, I didn't even know what I was supposed to have done with my time off to improve my gpa. For me, the problem lied in my mentality and not the challenge of the workload. For whatever reason I could not bring myself to do my coursework on time. This made me reflect about whether I am someone who can enjoy the life of a university student. After a bit of soul-searching I realized I absolutely hated the idea of university. The main reason I hated it was the lack of connection to the real world. I rarely came across a lecture where a professor would say “This is something you might encounter in the workforce”. There was no sense of urgency in learning the material that I was being taught, it was all just a matter of completing my work and getting at least a C. It finally made sense why I could not bring myself to do my work on time, it was because I could not envision this work being relevant to the actual tech industry because I had no prior knowledge of what it really means to build software. All the theory we were learning would have been a lot more meaningful if I could relate it to some software I had built. For instance, learning about complexity was only interesting to me when I actually programmed a sorting algorithm, and saw how it was more costly when compared to quicksort. I felt pretty relieved to finally come to this conclusion that I needed to learn programming in a non-traditional way.</p>
      <p>This was around the time when my brother directed me to the series of courses called <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/courses">Learn Enough to be Dangerous</a> by <a href="https://www.michaelhartl.com/">Michael Hartl.</a> He recommended this course to me because it teaches aspiring developers about web development in an organized way. Each course in the tutorial builds on the last one starting from the first course, Learn Enough Command Line to be dangerous. By the end of the course you will have all the fundamental knowledge you need to build a clone of Twitter with Ruby on Rails. I wrote a blog post about why I believe Ruby on Rails was the perfect web development framework for me to learn as somebody with no experience in the field, and I still agree with my take. It was empowering to know that I could learn how to build a website in such a short amount of time especially considering how I had such a hard time motivating myself to do work in university. This also confirmed to me that I was capable of learning how to become a developer.</p>
      <p>While I was building confidence in my skills as a programmer, I wanted to have more relevant projects and experience that would help me prepare for joining the tech industry. There are soft skills that you need in order to land a job such as, communicating about code concisely, and this is something that is hard to practice unless you do some mock interviews. Also being able to pair-program without getting nervous is a useful skill to have. I thought how building projects with a team and with some mentor guidance would be perfect to really assimilate myself into the tech workforce, however I didn’t know where I was going to find the opportunity to do these things without actually landing a job as an intern or junior developer. This is when my brother recommended I do a web development bootcamp, specifically Lighthouse Labs. He knew they had a good reputation because he knew about a few coworkers who were alumni from Lighthouse Labs. They all had many positive things to say about their experience there.</p> 
      <p>When I applied for the bootcamp, I heard back from them very quickly and we scheduled an interview. The interview consisted of a few questions asking me about why I want to learn how to program, and what experiences I had with programming. After about thirty minutes of answering a few questions we did a logic test where I had 10 minutes to answer about 5 questions that did not have anything to do with programming. The questions were similar to what you might find on an IQ test, and while I was not a fan of this process, I was pretty relieved to find that I passed. A few weeks later I found that I was accepted into the bootcamp. Read my next blog post to learn more about my experience during the course of the bootcamp!</p>
